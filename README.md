# Inter Club League

## Ideas

### GraphQL API

- Add versioning to endpoints
  - /v1/graphql
  - /v2/graphql

### Schedule page

- Horizontal GC scroller
- "Next event" card at the top
- API response should include nextEvent, primarySchedule and secondarySchedule fields

### Settings page

- iPhone settings style
- Season selector
- Light / dark theme selector
- Home page selector

### Stage page

- API response should include info
  - list of strings which are separated into paragraphs in the UI
- "Add to calendar" feature

### Stage results page

- Main page should show a list of races / groups
- User can click on group to view results

### GC page

- Filter by category (how does it work with upgrades)

### Rider stats page

- Show list of races and results, medals, position, unplaced, DNS etc
- Show GC winner
- Stats like number of wins, medals, places, races finished, upgrades etc
