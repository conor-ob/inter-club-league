    "No need for numbers on Bikes or Jersey. The only number you need to remember is your sign-on number",
    "If you aren’t used to TTs it’s really important to shout that number as you go across the line",
    "If you're parked up at the finish we suggest to ride down to the start via Burrow Road and loop around rather than going down Stepaside Lane (in the wet)",
    "Once you're signed on don’t hang around the start until a few minutes before you're off. It’s a narrow road and we don’t want to annoy the locals",
    "DO NOT go back to the finish looking for your time. We will be busy taking times for everyone else",
    "It’s a very hard start. Give yourself plenty of time to do a warmup before"
