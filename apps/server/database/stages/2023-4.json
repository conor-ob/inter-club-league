    "This time last year our friend and club mate Donal Gleeson was taken from us suddenly following the 312 in Majorca. This week’s race, which will become a yearly event, is run in his honour. A perpetual memorial cup will be presented to the winner after the race at the finish line by members of Donal’s family",
    "The race will be run as a handicap for all 4 groups, Limit going off first with a healthy handicap and Scratch last",
    "Distance will likely be just 2 laps of Green Sheds circuit (~35km), so short and sharp",
    "Points for first 6 riders across the line",
    "Sign on will close at 18:50"
